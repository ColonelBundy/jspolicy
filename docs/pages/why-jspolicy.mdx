jsPolicy is a policy engine for Kubernetes that allows you to write policies in JavaScript or TypeScript.

## Benefits

### Lightning Fast & Secure Policy Execution
jsPolicy runs policies with Google's super-fast V8 JavaScript engine in a pool of pre-heated sandbox environments. Most policies do not even take a single millisecond to execute

### Great Language For Policies
JavaScript is made for handling and manipulating JSON objects (short for "JavaScript Object Notation" (!)) and Kubernetes uses JSON by converting your YAML to JSON during every API request

### 3 Policy Types
- **Validating Policies** - Request validation that is as easy as calling `allow()`, `deny("This is not allowed")`, or `warn("We'll let this one slip, but upgrade to the new ingress controller")`
- **Mutating Policies** - Simple mutations of the kubectl request payload via `mutate(modifiedObj)`
- **Controller Policies** - Run custom JavaScript controllers that react to any changes to the objects in your cluster (controller policies are reactive, so they are not webhooks and part of a Kubernetes API server request but instead react to `Events` in your cluster after they have happened). With controller policies you can write resource sync mechanisms, enforce objects in namespaces, garbage collectors or fully functional CRD controllers

### Simple yet Powerful
Create a functional webhook with a single line of JavaScript or write your own fully blown custom StatefulSet controller in TypeScript with jsPolicy. There are no limits and the possibilities are endless

### Easy Cluster Access
Control cluster state with built-in functions such as `get("Pod", "v1", "my-namespace/my-pod")`, `list("Namespace", "v1")`, `create(limitRange)`, `update(mySecret)` or `remove(configMap)`

### Focus on Policy Logic
Jump right in and only focus on writing your own policy logic or simply reuse existing policies. Let jsPolicy do the rest and don't worry about high-availability, performance tuning, auditing, certificate management, webhook registration, Prometheus metrics, shared resource caches, controller boilerplate, dynamic policy management etc. anymore

### Turing Complete Policy Language
Use `loops`, `Promises`, `generator` functions, `?` operators, TypeScript Type-Safe practices, hot reloaders, linting, test frameworks and all other modern JS language features and development best practices for writing clean and easy to maintain policy code

### Huge Ecosystem of Libraries
Use any CommonJS JavaScript or TypeScript library from npmjs or from your private registry

### Easy Policy Sharing & Reuse
Share entire policies or reusable functions via npmjs or via your private registry

### Efficient Policy Development
Use any of the dev tools available in JavaScript or TypeScript for a highly efficient workflow
