title: remove() Function
sidebar_label: remove()

The `remove()` function is able to delete any resource in the Kubernetes cluster. `remove()` takes parameters in the form of `remove(oldToDelete)`. JsPolicy will then try to delete this object in the Kubernetes cluster and return the deleted object on success or an error if deletion has failed.

### Example

This example shows how to delete an object in the cluster via `remove()`.
```
apiVersion: policy.jspolicy.com/v1beta1
kind: JsPolicy
metadata:
  name: "remove.resource.example"
spec:
  operations: ["DELETE"]
  resources: ["pods"]
  javascript: |
    // remove() is able to delete any resource in the kubernetes cluster
    // remove() takes parameters in the form of (oldObject)
    // this will delete a configmap in the namespace with the same name as the pod
    const configMap = get("ConfigMap", "v1", request.namespace + "/" + request.name);
    if (configMap) {
      const result = remove(configMap);
      if (!result.ok) {
        // check for a specific error type
        if (result.reason === "NotFound") {
          warn(`ConfigMap was deleted by someone else`);
        } else {
          warn(`Error deleting ConfigMap (Reason ${result.reason}): ${result.message}`);
        }
      } else {
        print("Deleted ConfigMap", result.object);
      }
    } else {
      warn(`ConfigMap ${request.namespace}/${request.name} was not found`);
    }
```
