The `import` statement can be used to import dependencies that contain certain functionality you want to use within your policy. Dependencies are specified via the `spec.dependencies` option. JsPolicy will bundle all dependencies including the policy payload into a single minified bundle that is saved as `JsPolicyBundle` with the same name as the `JsPolicy` in the cluster.  

:::hint
You can also import packages from private npm registries by overwriting the `~/.npmrc` 
:::

### Example

This example shows how to import `loadash` into a `JsPolicy`.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.jspolicy.com/v1beta1
kind: JsPolicy
metadata:
  name: "dependency-policy.example.com"
spec:
  operations: ["CREATE"]
  resources: ["pods"]
  # Same syntax here as in a package.json
  # All commonjs packages in the npm registry are supported
  #
  # Internally, jsPolicy will run npm install for these and
  # bundle & minify the complete policy with webpack
  # 
  # To pull packages from a private npm registry
  # you will need to override the ~/.npmrc of the
  # jspolicy container.
  dependencies:
    lodash: "^4.17.21"
  javascript: |
    import _ from 'lodash';

    // check if forbidden label set is used
    if (_.isEqual(request.object.metadata?.labels, {"my-forbidden-label": "my-forbbiden-value"})) {
      deny("forbidden label set encountered"); // ends execution here
    }
```
