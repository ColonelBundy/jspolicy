title: mutate() Function
sidebar_label: mutate()
---

The `mutate()` function only works in mutating policies and tells jsPolicy to calculate a patch between the original `request.object` and the newly passed object. 
As soon as `mutate(changedObj)` is called, execution will be stopped. JsPolicy will remember the original `request.object`, which means you can freely change this object within the policy and call `mutate(request.object)` afterwards.
If the passed object and the original object do not have any differences, jsPolicy will do nothing.

### Example

```
apiVersion: policy.jspolicy.com/v1beta1
kind: JsPolicy
metadata:
  name: "set-annotation.example.com"
spec:
  type: Mutating
  operations: ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
  resources: ["pods"]
  javascript: |
    // This policy will set a required annotation on a pod during CREATE or UPDATE
    if (request.object.metadata.annotations?.["required-annotation"] !== "is-required") {
      // set annotation required-annotation=is-required
      request.object.metadata.annotations = {...request.object.metadata.annotations, 'required-annotation': 'is-required'};
          
      // tell jspolicy to calc the patch and exit
      mutate(request.object);
    }

    // if execution reaches here, request is allowed and nothing happens
```
