title: exit() Function
sidebar_label: exit()
---

The `exit()` function stops execution immediately. In a validating or mutating policy, this is equal to calling `allow()`, because if no `deny()` is called a request is always allowed (expect if there is a javascript error or timeout).

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.jspolicy.com/v1beta1
kind: JsPolicy
metadata:
  name: "env.example.com"
spec:
  operations: ["CREATE"]
  resources: ["pods"]
  javascript: |
    exit();
    
    // this is never reached
    deny("I'm not executed");
```
