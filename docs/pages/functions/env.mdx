title: env() Function
sidebar_label: env()
---

The `env()` function retrieves an environment variable of the jsPolicy pod as a string. If the environment variable cannot be found `undefined` is returned.

### Example

This example only prints to the log stream if the environment variable `DEBUG` is set.

```
apiVersion: policy.jspolicy.com/v1beta1
kind: JsPolicy
metadata:
  name: "env.example.com"
spec:
  operations: ["CREATE"]
  resources: ["pods"]
  javascript: |
    // env() retrieves an environment variable from the jspolicy container
    if (env("DEBUG") === "true") {
      print("Log this Pod Creation to the console"))
    }
```
