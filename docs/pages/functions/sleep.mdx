sidebar_label: sleep()
---

The `sleep()` function halts execution for the specified milliseconds.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.jspolicy.com/v1beta1
kind: JsPolicy
metadata:
  name: "pod-sleep.example.com"
spec:
  operations:  ["CREATE"]
  resources:   ["pods"]
  javascript: |
    // you should usually never(!) sleep inside a webhook,
    // however there might be situations where you need to wait for
    // something to happen in the cluster, so this function exists
    //
    // remember you can use {cache: false} as well for get() and list()
    // if you need timing critical webhooks
    const before = new Date().getTime();
    sleep(1000); // sleep for 1 second
    print(`Slept for ${(new Date().getTime() - before)}`);
```
