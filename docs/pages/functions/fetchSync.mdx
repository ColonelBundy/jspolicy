title: fetchSync() Function
sidebar_label: fetchSync()
---

The `fetchSync()` function allows you to make http(s) requests to backend servers to record or query information. The syntax is similar to the standard [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) API, however with the difference that `fetchSync` does not return a promise and instead executes the request synchronously. 

### Example 
This policy will print the current IP address of the node where jsPolicy runs on and tries to query an address that does not exist.
```
apiVersion: policy.jspolicy.com/v1beta1
kind: JsPolicy
metadata:
  name: "fetch.example.com"
spec:
  operations: ["CREATE"]
  resources: ["pods"]
  javascript: |
    // use fetchSync to make requests to backend servers
    const res = fetchSync("https://ip.seeip.org/jsonip", {
      method: "GET",
      headers: {
        "X-Custom-HTTP-Header": "test"
      },
    });
    if (res.ok) {
      print("jspolicy ip: " + res.json().ip);
    }
    
    // you can also use try catch to handle network errors
    try {
      fetchSync("https://this.will.not.exist.tld");
    } catch(err) {
      print("Catched fetchSync: " + err);
    }
```
