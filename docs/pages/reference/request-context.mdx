## Action
### `operation`
Operation is the operation being performed. Can be either "CREATE", "UPDATE", "DELETE" or "CONNECT". This may be different than the original operation requested. e.g. a patch can result in either a CREATE or UPDATE Operation. In controller policies this can be only CREATE or DELETE.

### `dryRun`
DryRun indicates that modifications will definitely not be persisted for this request.

## Object
### `object`
Object is the object from the incoming request. In CREATE or UPDATE request this will be filled, in DELETE requests this is empty.

### `oldObject`
OldObject is the currently existing object. Only populated for DELETE and UPDATE requests.

## Object Metadata
### `kind.kind`
### `kind.group`
### `kind.version`
Kind is the fully-qualified type of object being submitted (for example, v1.Pod or autoscaling.v1.Scale)

### `name`
Name is the name of the object as presented in the request. On a CREATE operation, the client may omit name and rely on the server to generate the name.  If that is the case, this field will contain an empty string.

### `namespace`
Namespace is the namespace associated with the request (if any).

### `resource.resource`
### `resource.group`
### `resource.version`
Resource is the fully-qualified resource being requested (for example, v1.pods)

### `subResource`
SubResource is the subresource being requested, if any (for example, "status" or "scale")

## User
### `userInfo`
UserInfo is information about the requesting user

#### `username`
The name that uniquely identifies this user among all active users.

#### `uid`
A unique value that identifies this user across time. If this user is deleted and another user by the same name is added, they will have different UIDs.

#### `groups`
The names of groups this user is a part of.

#### `extra`
Any additional information provided by the authenticator.

## Request Metadata
### `uid`
UID is an identifier for the individual request/response. It allows us to distinguish instances of requests which are otherwise identical (parallel requests, requests when earlier requests did not modify etc).
The UID is meant to track the round trip (request/response) between the KAS and the WebHook, not the user request.
It is suitable for correlating log entries between the webhook and apiserver, for either auditing or debugging.

### `requestKind`
RequestKind is the fully-qualified type of the original API request (for example, v1.Pod or autoscaling.v1.Scale).
If this is specified and differs from the value in "kind", an equivalent match and conversion was performed.

### `requestResource`
RequestResource is the fully-qualified resource of the original API request (for example, v1.pods).
If this is specified and differs from the value in "resource", an equivalent match and conversion was performed.

### `requestSubResource`
RequestSubResource is the name of the subresource of the original API request, if any (for example, "status" or "scale").
If this is specified and differs from the value in "subResource", an equivalent match and conversion was performed.
