`Mutating` and `Validating` policies run during a HTTP request to the Kubernetes API server. After Kubernetes performs authentication and authorization (RBAC), it runs the `Mutating` policies sequentially and then runs all `Validating` policies in parallel. If any of the `Validating` policies calls `deny()`, the request will be aborted and not persited in etcd.

`Controller` policies are **not** part of any Kubernetes API server request. Instead, they are triggered asynchronuously by `Events` in your Kubernetes cluster. Every CRUD operation on any of the Kubernetes objects in your cluster creates an `Event`. jsPolicy listens to these events and executes the matching `Controller` policies which can perform any kind of action in response to an `Event`, including also executing other CRUD operations in your cluster.

:::note Deny vs Warn
Mutating and validating policies may also use `warn()` to display warnings to client, i.e. these warnings will not impact the request itself but they are shown in the `kubectl` output for example.
